# Goal
@snapend

@snap[midpoint text-15 span-100]
Think Different
@snapend


Note:
- Showcase a different way to do things in PL/SQL
- Who is this for? Devs / Managers
- Devs: â€œI could do that in PLSQL easily etc"
- Managers: Think about how you or business users on your team could offload work from Devs to free them up
