Note:

Business Users:
- Want answers / solutions
- Frequent design changes
- Quick turn over

Nerds
- Scared / limited resource
- Code is resource intensive
- Don't like changes

Current workflow:
- Business users describe what they "think" they want
- Throw it over the fence
- Devs build it.
- Repeat

Note:

- Rethink the problem
- What If...
  - Developers didn't need to do the work? Or minimal amount of it?
  - Citizen Developers
    - Move some of load business users
  - Even if getting POCs out can quickly produce prototypes.
